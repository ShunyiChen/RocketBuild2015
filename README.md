What's the TruCoreMobileService?

Now the answer to the question I can tell you:For file sender,user can firstly login to a android client,choose a partner from a list of available partners,then select a file you want to share with your partner to upload to this TruCoreMobileService,file will be encrypted and saved in this process.For file receiver,user can firstly login to a iOS device client(like iphone,ipad,ipod),choose a download file from a list of available download files,then select a file to download to your local file system,file will be also decrypted in this process.

PS:TruCoreMobileService's backend is not trivial.
