What's the TruCoreMobileService?

First,it is a mobile service or transit point for sending and receiving file.For file sender,user can login to a android client,choose a partner from a list of available partners,then select a file you want to share with your partner to upload to TruCoreMobileService,Meanwhile file will be encrypted and saved.For file receiver,user can firstly login to a iOS device client(like iphone,ipad,ipod),choose a download file from a list of available download files,then select a file to download to his or her local file system,file will be also decrypted in this process.
